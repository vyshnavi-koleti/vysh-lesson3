        <p>Let's travel back to mid 2000s.The question What's your BBM pin was as common as asking your phone number. This was around the time when Blackberry dominated the smartphone market. After hurting our fingers on the Nokia's numeric keypads for years, the shift to blackberry's qwerty keypad was nothing short of iconic.It made texting and checking emails a thousand times easier. But how many people do you now see using Blackberry? The answer is perhaps 0. The company went from holding over 20% of the global smartphone market to almost zero in a few short years. How did this happen?</p>
